                "body": "Dear David,\n\nThank you for the comprehensive update. We're very pleased with the progress, especially the inclusion of the environmental science lab and the wind turbine.\n\nThe school board is particularly excited about the 'sustainability trail' concept. We believe this will be a powerful educational tool.\n\nOne final request: could we explore the possibility of a small greenhouse for year-round gardening projects?\n\nLooking forward to our next meeting.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Emily Johnson",
